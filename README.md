SyntheticSun
============

Python script to precisely control grow light fixtures according to your current locations sunrise and sunset.


As of right now everything is hardcoded to my location, Platteville WI. If anyone wanted to make it customizable via command-line options and [argparse](https://docs.python.org/3.2/library/argparse.html) I would happily merge it in.
