SyntheticSun
============

Python script to precisely control grow light fixtures according to your current locations sunrise and sunset in order to accurately simulate [photoperiodism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photoperiodism#In_plants). This means that your plants will recieve a different amount of daylight each day just like they would with natural light. Also this is a justification for me to use a raspberry pi to control grow lights rather than a $5 timer.


As of right now everything is hardcoded to my location, Platteville WI. If anyone wanted to make it customizable via command-line options and [argparse](https://docs.python.org/3.2/library/argparse.html) I would happily merge it in.
